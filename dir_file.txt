#	The first 4 lines in this file is are directories:
#		1. main_dir_1		- First directory to find files for comparison.
#		2. main_dir_2		- Second directory to find files for comparison.
#		3. output_root_dir	- First (and currently only) output "root" folder.
#		4. unused			- Might be used for something, I guess.
#	DO NOT change the first lines without being sure what you are doing. 
#	This is a test file though :P
